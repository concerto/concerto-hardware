// This is a manifest file that will compile javascripts used by this plugn's
// views. This plugin is configured to use the main application's layouts, so
// it adds to what is available there, and its assets are not meant for

// The plugin is added to the application's layout via a hook in enine.rb.
//
// We make the assumption that jquery and jquery_ujs have been included
// by Concerto's application.js before this file is loaded, so we can
// skip those includes.

// It's not advisable to add code directly here, but if you do, it'll appear
// at the bottom of the compiled file.
